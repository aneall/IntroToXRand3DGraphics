# Intro To XR and 3D Graphics Workshop
A workshop created by Ashley Neall for [PearlHacks 2024](https://pearlhacks.com/) â€“ UNC-Chapel Hill's annual hackathon uplifting women in CS!

## An Introduction
This workshop introduces students to extended reality (XR) and specifically how to **visually** immerse users in XR experiences with 3D computer graphics. I begin with a conceptual overview of what XR is (based on my own definition and schematics), and then move into explaining some computer graphics concepts. The hands-on aspect of this workshop involves every workshop attendee creating their own web-based XR experience with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) while using the [Glitch IDE](https://glitch.com/) for accessible setup.

At the conclusion of this workshop, I encourage students to read the extra slides and explore linked resources as they complete their PearlHacks projects :) Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, and if this workshop has sparked an interest in XR and graphics, consider [joining Carolina AR/VR](https://linktr.ee/carvr)!

For those interested, check out [my Personal Website in XR!](https://ashleyinvr.glitch.me/) as an example!

## Pre-Workshop Setup
Please make sure to complete the following steps *before* attending the workshop, as you will not have time during the workshop:
1. Create a Glitch account. [Follow this link](https://glitch.com/) and click 'Sign Up'.
2. Bookmark this repository (as you will be using the 3D assets and boilerplate code during the workshop).
3. Read [this page](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/).
4. (Optional) Explore A-Frame Docs to get ahead!
